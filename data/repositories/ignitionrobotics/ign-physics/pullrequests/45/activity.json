needed to call the `ForwardStep` API. The `GetEntities` feature has a way to call `GetEngine()->GetWorld()`, but it has lots of other required API's related to Models, Links, Joints, and Shapes.\r\n\r\nIn order to simplify the implementation task, I've split the `GetEntities` feature into subfeatures, so that only a subset of the API needs to be implemented for the `DoublePendulum` example. For this pull request, the diff is much easier to see when looking directly at the commits:\r\n\r\n* 60d36d9: create a feature list called `GetEntitiesList` and change downstream code to reference this instead of `GetEntities`\r\n* f55f2f6: move some functions to a `GetEntine` feature and add it to `GetEntitiesList`\r\n* fcc7340: move more functions to a `EngineGetWorld` feature and add to `GetEntitiesList`. \r\n\r\nI believe these two additional features are enough for the `DoublePendulum` example, but since I had started the process, I went ahead and added `ModelGetLink`, `ModelGetJoint`, and `LinkGetShape` as well in subsequent commits.", "title": "Split GetEntities feature into multiple subfeatures", "destination": {"commit": {"hash": "dae6bdd2fb6a", "type": "commit", "links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/ignitionrobotics/ign-physics/commit/dae6bdd2fb6a.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/ignitionrobotics/ign-physics/commits/dae6bdd2fb6a"}}}, "repository": {"links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/ignitionrobotics/ign-physics.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/ignitionrobotics/ign-physics"}, "avatar": {"href": "data/bytebucket.org/ravatar/{63a01c4f-5625-443b-96f0-73c4005ccada}ts=c_plus_plus"}}, "type": "repository", "name": "ign-physics", "full_name": "ignitionrobotics/ign-physics", "uuid": "{63a01c4f-5625-443b-96f0-73c4005ccada}"}, "branch": {"name": "default"}}, "reason": "", "source": {"commit": {"hash": "66de12e902c2", "type": "commit", "links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/ignitionrobotics/ign-physics/commit/66de12e902c2.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/ignitionrobotics/ign-physics/commits/66de12e902c2"}}}, "repository": {"links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/ignitionrobotics/ign-physics.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/ignitionrobotics/ign-physics"}, "avatar": {"href": "data/bytebucket.org/ravatar/{63a01c4f-5625-443b-96f0-73c4005ccada}ts=c_plus_plus"}}, "type": "repository", "name": "ign-physics", "full_name": "ignitionrobotics/ign-physics", "uuid": "{63a01c4f-5625-443b-96f0-73c4005ccada}"}, "branch": {"name": "split_GetEntities"}}, "state": "OPEN", "author": {"display_name": "Steve Peters", "uuid": "{2ccfed09-18b8-4921-8d58-15ef01092802}", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/%7B2ccfed09-18b8-4921-8d58-15ef01092802%7D"}, "html": {"href": "https://bitbucket.org/%7B2ccfed09-18b8-4921-8d58-15ef01092802%7D/"}, "avatar": {"href": "data/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/1fb4816dad9e68337d3096f750951f6cd=httpsavatar-management--avatars.us-west-2.prod.public.atl-paas.netinitialsSP-1.png"}}, "nickname": "Steven Peters", "type": "user", "account_id": "557058:5de38267-b118-494c-aa76-4fab35448816"}, "date": "2018-12-05T01:18:56.150122+00:00"}, "pull_request": {"type": "pullrequest", "id": 45, "links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/ignitionrobotics/ign-physics/pullrequests/45.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/ignitionrobotics/ign-physics/pull-requests/45"}}, "title": "Split GetEntities feature into multiple subfeatures"}}, {"comment": {"links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/ignitionrobotics/ign-physics/pullrequests/45/comments/84573544.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/ignitionrobotics/ign-physics/pull-requests/45/_/diff#comment-84573544"}}, "parent": {"id": 84434872, "links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/ignitionrobotics/ign-physics/pullrequests/45/comments/84434872.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/ignitionrobotics/ign-physics/pull-requests/45/_/diff#comment-84434872"}}}, "deleted": false, "pullrequest": {"type": "pullrequest", "id": 45, "links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/ignitionrobotics/ign-physics/pullrequests/45.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/ignitionrobotics/ign-physics/pull-requests/45"}}, "title": "Split GetEntities feature into multiple subfeatures"}, "content": {"raw": "these all sound good;
