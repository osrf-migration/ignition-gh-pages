The architecture of `ign-physics` supports composing different features exactly so we don't need to \"fake\" that a feature exists. On Gazebo-classic for example, we needed to do that because it used inheritance.\n\nSo the Bullet plugin should offer only exactly the features that are known to work, and `ign-gazebo`'s physics system should be less strict about the minimum features it requires from engines. We could implement a fallback behaviour in `ign-gazebo` so that if a mesh is used with an engine that doesn't have `AttachMeshShapeFeature`, it prints an error and maybe loads a placeholder shape.
