There are many different categories of force that act on a body:\n\n1. External forces applied by:\n\n    1. Collision\n    2. Friction\n    3. Other physical systems \\(e.g. magnetic\\)\n    4. The \u201cHand of God\u201d \\(i.e. the user applying a force for experimental purposes\\)\n    \n2. Internal forces applied by:\n\n    1. Joint constraints\n    2. Actuator force\n    \n\nHaving a function that's just called `SetForce(~)` leaves it ambiguous which of the above categories of force are being set. I would assume it means 1\\(d\\), but I can't rule out the possibility that it might also overwrite the values of 1\\(a-c\\). Having a function called `GetForce(~)` might imply that it's the sum of all the forces 1\\(a-d\\) \\+ 2\\(a-b\\), but then it wouldn\u2019t be symmetrical with the `SetForce(~)` function.\n\nI would recommend that we make these function names more specific. Some possible names to consider:\n\n    [Set|Get]AppliedForce() // refers to 1(d)\n    GetExternalForce() // refers to the sum of 1(a-d)\n    GetInternalForce() // refers to the sum of 2(a-b)\n    GetNetForce() // refers to the sum of all forces", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>I'm a little worried about the naming of the <code>[Set|Get][Force|Torque]()</code> functions.
