One of the tests is using `Eigen` to show how a single \"feature\" can be used to construct an API for both 2D and 3D simulations (see `test/MockCenterOfMass`). `Eigen` is useful for this because the `Eigen` data structures can be templated on the dimensionality of the matrix/vector. This means that the tests currently depend on `Eigen`, and we need to use the current `default` branch of `ign-cmake`.\n\n2. We need to use the `BetterPluginRegistration_DllManagement` branch of `ign-common`, because that's where proper support for template interfaces is introduced. I'll look into getting the `ign-plugin` repo into serviceable shape to be used by `ign-physics`, but my time available for ignition work this week might be somewhat limited.", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>I've removed the WIP tag because I'm satisfied with the implementation and tests (of course there could always be more testing, but I believe the critical concepts of the Feature System are being adequately tested now).</p>\n<p>There are still two caveats for this PR:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>One of the tests is using <code>Eigen</code> to show how a single \"feature\" can be used to construct an API for both 2D and 3D simulations (see <code>test/MockCenterOfMass</code>). <code>Eigen</code> is useful for this because the <code>Eigen</code> data structures can be templated on the dimensionality of the matrix/vector.
