There are three mock \"features\": `EngineMockFeature`, `LinkMockFeature`, and `SecondLinkMockFeature`. Each of these defines a function within a nested class (`Engine` or `Link`). We create a `FeatureList` which combines all these features, and then use `Engine3d` and `Link3d`  to extract and combine their APIs. As a result, `Link3d<MockList>` contains both of the functions defined in `LinkMockFeature` and `SecondLinkMockFeature`.\r\n\r\n~~My next step will be to add more concrete and illustrative tests to `Feature_TEST.cc`.~~\r\n\r\nTo see a full-fledged test use of the Feature System, see `test/integration/FeatureSystem.cc`.", "title": "Feature System", "destination": {"commit": {"hash": "3bf87fe246a9", "type": "commit", "links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/ignitionrobotics/ign-physics/commit/3bf87fe246a9.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/ignitionrobotics/ign-physics/commits/3bf87fe246a9"}}}, "repository": {"links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/ignitionrobotics/ign-physics.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/ignitionrobotics/ign-physics"}, "avatar": {"href": "data/bytebucket.org/ravatar/{63a01c4f-5625-443b-96f0-73c4005ccada}ts=c_plus_plus"}}, "type": "repository", "name": "ign-physics", "full_name": "ignitionrobotics/ign-physics", "uuid": "{63a01c4f-5625-443b-96f0-73c4005ccada}"}, "branch": {"name": "default"}}, "reason": "", "source": {"commit": {"hash": "453bf2e55b94", "type": "commit", "links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/ignitionrobotics/ign-physics/commit/453bf2e55b94.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/ignitionrobotics/ign-physics/commits/453bf2e55b94"}}}, "repository": {"links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/ignitionrobotics/ign-physics.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/ignitionrobotics/ign-physics"}, "avatar": {"href": "data/bytebucket.org/ravatar/{63a01c4f-5625-443b-96f0-73c4005ccada}ts=c_plus_plus"}}, "type": "repository", "name": "ign-physics", "full_name": "ignitionrobotics/ign-physics", "uuid": "{63a01c4f-5625-443b-96f0-73c4005ccada}"}, "branch": {"name": "FeatureSystem_raw"}}, "state": "OPEN", "author": {"display_name": "Steve Peters", "uuid": "{2ccfed09-18b8-4921-8d58-15ef01092802}", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/%7B2ccfed09-18b8-4921-8d58-15ef01092802%7D"}, "html": {"href": "https://bitbucket.org/%7B2ccfed09-18b8-4921-8d58-15ef01092802%7D/"}, "avatar": {"href": "data/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/1fb4816dad9e68337d3096f750951f6cd=httpsavatar-management--avatars.us-west-2.prod.public.atl-paas.netinitialsSP-1.png"}}, "nickname": "Steven Peters", "type": "user", "account_id": "557058:5de38267-b118-494c-aa76-4fab35448816"}, "date": "2018-07-11T00:50:55.257267+00:00"}, "pull_request": {"type": "pullrequest", "id": 24, "links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/ignitionrobotics/ign-physics/pullrequests/24.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/ignitionrobotics/ign-physics/pull-requests/24"}}, "title": "Feature System Part 1"}}, {"comment": {"links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/ignitionrobotics/ign-physics/pullrequests/24/comments/69569073.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/ignitionrobotics/ign-physics/pull-requests/24/_/diff#comment-69569073"}}, "deleted": false, "pullrequest": {"type": "pullrequest", "id": 24, "links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/ignitionrobotics/ign-physics/pullrequests/24.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/ignitionrobotics/ign-physics/pull-requests/24"}}, "title": "Feature System Part 1"}, "content": {"raw": "I just finished reading all the code; it looks pretty good to me, aside from a few small comments.\n\nDo you have an estimate for when ign-plugin would be ready?", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>I just finished reading all the code; it looks pretty good to me, aside from a few small comments.</p>\n<p>Do you have an estimate for when ign-plugin would be ready?</p>", "type": "rendered"}, "created_on": "2018-07-11T00:00:10.499175+00:00", "user": {"display_name": "Steve Peters", "uuid": "{2ccfed09-18b8-4921-8d58-15ef01092802}", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/%7B2ccfed09-18b8-4921-8d58-15ef01092802%7D"}, "html": {"href": "https://bitbucket.org/%7B2ccfed09-18b8-4921-8d58-15ef01092802%7D/"}, "avatar": {"href": "data/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/1fb4816dad9e68337d3096f750951f6cd=httpsavatar-management--avatars.us-west-2.prod.public.atl-paas.netinitialsSP-1.png"}}, "nickname": "Steven Peters", "type": "user", "account_id": "557058:5de38267-b118-494c-aa76-4fab35448816"}, "updated_on": "2018-07-11T00:00:10.510328+00:00", "type": "pullrequest_comment", "id": 69569073}, "pull_request": {"type": "pullrequest", "id": 24, "links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/ignitionrobotics/ign-physics/pullrequests/24.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/ignitionrobotics/ign-physics/pull-requests/24"}}, "title": "Feature System Part 1"}}], "next": "data/repositories/ignitionrobotics/ign-physics/pullrequests/24/activity_ctx=4BSMFysb.json"}
