With both physics engines installed, this branch provides a prototype of the physics abstraction layer. To simplify the build process and loading and finding plugin libraries, the `BulletDoublePendulum` plugin is added to the `ignition-physics-dart` library by using the same folder and adding symbols to the plugins.cc.
