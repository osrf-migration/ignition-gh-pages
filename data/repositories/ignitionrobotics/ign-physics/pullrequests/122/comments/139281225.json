Instead my concern is, we fix a bug in a header file implementation and make a release of ign-physics, but users don't get the fix unless they rebuild. ign-gazebo users that install from debs won't get the fix because even though they have a new ign-physics deb, they won't have an ign-gazebo that has been built against the new changes.
