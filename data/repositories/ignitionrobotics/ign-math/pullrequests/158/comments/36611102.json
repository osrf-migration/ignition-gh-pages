However, this list of vertices is not a path, it should be interpreted as the order in which the vertices were picked. We could add a destination node as you suggested, but this algorithm will be interpreted as a search algorithm in the sense that you could know if the target node is reachable. But as I mentioned before, the list of returned nodes is not going to be a path. I'll add this search algorithm when we submit the real pull request intended to be merged.
