Without the changes I think it returns 0 for the lengths and center. We could get 0 for the lengths by taking the greater of the current result and 0. Would that make more sense? That way the value would not change after one corner is set.\n\nFor the center, I wonder what would make most sense for an uninitialized box. In a way it is nowhere and everywhere.\n\nEither way, documenting the expected outcomes sounds like a good idea. I can add a description as well as the DefaultConstructor test.\n\nThanks!", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>Interesting. Without the changes I think it returns 0 for the lengths and center.
