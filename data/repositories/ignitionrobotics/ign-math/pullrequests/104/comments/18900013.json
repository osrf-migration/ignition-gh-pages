I imagine that they talk like \"Let's make 5 pound - 10 inch squire block in empty world\", and internally convert to meter/kg and create sdf world model for gazebo.\nAnd I think they always want to use inch/pound, but obey to use meter/kg with patient, in order to avoid confusion between meter and inch.\nIf this is the case, I think we have same situation between C/F, F is only used in US(**) and keep using C as default value in gazebo, and try not to use F as much as possible to avoid confusion.\nOf course, good question may be why not use K for default unit for temperature since that is a part of SI unit system, and my answer is I usually uses C in may daily life and also scientific discussion, so I understand why you want to show the result in F ;-)\n\n* http://sdformat.org/spec?ver=1.6&elem=physics, \n** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit#Usage\n\n![Countries_that_use_Fahrenheit.svg.png](data/bitbucket.org/repo/dg5enz/images/155433650-Countries_that_use_Fahrenheit.svg.png)", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>This is very interesting, I'm not sure how you feel about unit system in gazebo, but for example SDF (<em>) uses -9.8 for gravity, which is very natural for me like people who lives in meter unit system.\nBut I suppose since people in US use inch/pound in their daily life, so it is not easy for them to use meter/kg.
