I hesitated a lot before removing it because it looked cool and we put some time into making the tests pass, but I couldn't justify its existence without multiple canvases. Now exporting is done directly through \"Export\" buttons in the settings menu, It's worth mentioning that even though the `ExportDialog` handled multiple canvases at once, it was not combining the exported results in any way, so we didn't lose any functionality.\n* Removed several functions which were only used in tests and changed the tests so that functionality is triggered the same way the user would trigger it. The previous tests were not corresponding to the real usage of the plugin.\n\nDemo of `plot.config` with new functionality:\n\n![plotsingle.gif](data/bitbucket.org/repo/64K5zaR/images/788261392-plotsingle.gif)\n\n", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>This has been addressed in branch <code>plot_4_single_canvas</code> which was merged into this one.
