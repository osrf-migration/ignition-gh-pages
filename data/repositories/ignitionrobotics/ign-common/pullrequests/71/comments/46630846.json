Pull request #73 should be able to preserve the version history as it originally emerged. Thanks for the suggestion of breaking down the PR, though! Hopefully the review will be at least a little more manageable.\n\nA few things that pull request #73 does not address:\n\n1. It contains some vestigial functions which are not necessarily needed in the absence of the `PluginPtr` class. Those functions aren't hurting anything and will be needed later, so I'm leaving them in for now. If you feel that they are harmful to the review process, I can remove them in pull request #73 and then add them back in pull request #59.  The only reason I'm not doing that yet is because it would cause some redundant removals and reversions in the version history.\n\n2.
