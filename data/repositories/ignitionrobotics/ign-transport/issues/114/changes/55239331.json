{"changes": {"content": {"new": "# Description\r\n\r\nWhen we use ignition transport over WiFi we experience long delays on communication via \\(asynchronous\\) service calls and disconnects on pub/sub traffic. These seem to be accompanied with frequent detected disconnects and connects in the discovery layer. Interestingly, these delays seem to happen to a few nodes \\(but not all\\) at once and seem to resolve at the same time as well. We have been able to rule out any deadlock-like situations as our nodes will still accept and process service requests from nodes not affected by the delay in the network. Once the delay resolves, the messages seem to come in all at once.\r\n\r\nWe tested this problem with the basic example code from the source. When running the basic examples _publisher.cc_ and _subscriber.cc_ over WiFi, random disconnection callbacks are fired while both machines are still connected to the same network. We seem to experience similar problems with communication in the publisher/subscriber example which disconnects within a few minutes and in severe cases even seconds.\r\n\r\nTo rule out relevant external factors, we used an isolated network without any other active clients on a professional grade router and access-point but that seemed to have no influence on the robustness of the connections.
