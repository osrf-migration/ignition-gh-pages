I also wanted to mention that Asio is expected to eventually becomes part of the C++ Standard Library. When that comes to pass it should be minimally difficult to switch over and drop the asio dependency and just use the functionality provided by the standard library, allowing a dependency to be dropped in the future.\n\nI've used DDS before and it was a poor experience.
