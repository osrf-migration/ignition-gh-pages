That line executes on the subscriber side. This function is running when the discovery discovers a new topic. Then, we check if we have a local subscriber on that topic. If we have it, we have to check that the types match. If so, we send a message to the control address of the publisher to notify that we are a new remote subscriber. I haven't debug it but I think that we should be able to check that the types match here.\n\nIn the integration tests, `waitForSubscribers_aux` subscribes using a callback with type `ignition::msgs::Vector3d`. On the file `twoProcessesPubSub`, in both of your tests you're advertising with a different type. In that case I would say that there's no real remote subscriber, right? This seems like the correct behavior. We should try a third case where we advertise an `ignition::msgs::Vector3d` message, then we should see the remote subscriber.\n\nDoes it make sense?", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>I think we should keep the line.
