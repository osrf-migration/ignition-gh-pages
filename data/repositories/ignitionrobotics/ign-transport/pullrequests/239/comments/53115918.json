Basically, we need to link to the ZeroMQ target, but on Windows that target is called `libzmq` because that's the name that the ZeroMQ developers chose for it, and we're importing their target. CMake 3.5.1 doesn't have the ability to alias an imported target, so we need to use a variable to hold the target name to make sure that we'll link to the target regardless of the platform.\n\nWe could do a temporary workaround where `ign-transport` chooses which target it links to based on the platform it's running on, but I'd rather not freeze the code in that state.
