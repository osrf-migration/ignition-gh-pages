In Jackie's case, the public was the good one but it might be the other way around too. I think it's OK to choose public over private as a policy. If you know the proper network interface you can specify it with the `IGN_IP` environment variable.\n\nWe can merge this PR, it's a small patch but the way the discovery works will change in the future. Now, we're choosing one network interface but I'd like to bind to all the network interfaces and forward all the discovery messages through all of them. There are a few details to solve but I believe that in this way you won't have to worry about choosing one interface.\n\nOf course, this won't help in the Optitrack case unless we do a similar trick and use all the network interfaces.
