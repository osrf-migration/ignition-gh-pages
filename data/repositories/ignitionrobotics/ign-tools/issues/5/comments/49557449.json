I am currently running Ubuntu 18.04 with Gazebo 9, with which some of the ignition dependencies were installed. I looked for a newer deb release for version 5 and couldn't find it. Do you know when that release is going to happen?\n2. Is there a guide on how to generate the descriptor information using CMake directives? Since I am compiling already created custom messages without any descriptors associated. Any link you can point me in too so I can have that working? Also, can the `IGN_DESCRIPTOR_PATH` be added to `bashrc` for example so it can be considered every time one wants to interpret custom protobuf messages?", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>@caguero thank you very much for your feedback!</p>\n<p>So just a couple of questions regarding your answer:\n1.
