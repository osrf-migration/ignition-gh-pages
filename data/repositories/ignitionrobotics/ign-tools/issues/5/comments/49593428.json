I will try that and let you know.\n\nAlso regarding custom topics: I am using Gazebo 9, and I am trying to use the GUI real time plotting tool of it. I cannot plot any data from custom topics - the ones going over Gazebo Transport are detected but I can't select any field to plot, and the ones going over Ignition Tools don't even show up.\n\nSo my question is: do you have a suggestion for a tool that allows to real plot custom topics, without depending on ROS for that? (I know I could publish the data as ROS topics but that's not intended of course) Or, is there some recommendation you can give regarding this? Do I have to build Gazebo 9 from source to be able to plot custom topics? Or do I need some sort of plugin that assembles this data and plots it using some plotting tool?", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>@caguero thank you!
