To be more specific, we configure `Export.hh` from the file `ign-cmake/cmake/Export.hh.in` so that we have a file which presents the macros cleanly with in-header documentation, and then `GenerateExportHeader` is used to produce a file `detail/Export.hh` which is used by `Export.hh` to provide the actual implementation of the macros.\n\nCurrently many of the macros and functions in `ign-cmake` are specifically designed to only produce one designated \"ignition\" library per project (not counting auxiliary libraries which may be used for testing or example purposes).
