We don't want to print out an alarming warning, because it may be the case that we just haven't written any tests of that type yet. We can have the folder set up so that's it's ready to go if anyone wants to write a test of that type in the future; all they'd have to do is add a source file to the directory and run cmake.

Adding this warning to `ign-cmake` helped me identify 3 places in `ign-msgs` where this typo was occurring.
