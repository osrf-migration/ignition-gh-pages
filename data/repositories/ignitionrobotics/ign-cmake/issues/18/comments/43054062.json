They have zero effect on how the code itself gets interpreted. Any warning suppression methods that go beyond that would be outside the scope of the suppression macros.\n\nBesides \"easiness\", I'd like to emphasize that this would provide a more consistent experience for developers and for (in the case of Console) users across all the ignition projects.\n\nIt wouldn't be very difficult to make the Console code header-only if we wanted to go that route. It's probably not the most efficient design, but the Console isn't a terribly heavy feature, so I don't think it would have a noticeable impact on compilation time or code size.\n\nThe renaming isn't a critical part of the proposal. I'm mostly indifferent about it, but I'd encourage it if we were willing to do it.", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>Thanks for the chart, I think that's a very helpful overview.
