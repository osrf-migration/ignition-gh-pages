However, cmake targets don't have global scope (global imported targets aren't supported by cmake until <a data-is-external-link=\"true\" href=\"https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.11/prop_tgt/IMPORTED_GLOBAL.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">version 3.11</a>). Since the Gazebo config first gets loaded in the scope of library <code>L</code>'s CMakeLists.txt, its imported targets won't be visible in the scope of library <code>D</code>'s CMakeLists.txt because those scopes are parallel to each other. Nevertheless, the Gazebo config file won't reload in the scope of library <code>D</code> because it has already been loaded once for this project.</p>\n<p>Building the packages in isolated configurations is the safest and most sensible thing to do in all cases, not just in this particular case.</p>", "type": "rendered"}, "created_on": "2019-03-29T04:10:02.599993+00:00", "user": {"display_name": "Michael Grey", "uuid": "{c1cdfe52-2887-474c-ae99-72fdc53a59c9}", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/%7Bc1cdfe52-2887-474c-ae99-72fdc53a59c9%7D"}, "html": {"href": "https://bitbucket.org/%7Bc1cdfe52-2887-474c-ae99-72fdc53a59c9%7D/"}, "avatar": {"href": "https://avatar-management--avatars.us-west-2.prod.public.atl-paas.net/557058:67759e29-d1df-465f-868d-047738e36fc9/d42d74cf-c1bd-4431-8288-07f543bbe325/128"}}, "nickname": "mxgrey", "type": "user", "account_id": "557058:67759e29-d1df-465f-868d-047738e36fc9"}, "updated_on": null, "type": "issue_comment", "id": 51388228}, {"links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/ignitionrobotics/ign-cmake/issues/55/comments/51388232.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/ignitionrobotics/ign-cmake/issues/55#comment-51388232"}}, "issue": {"links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/ignitionrobotics/ign-cmake/issues/55.json"}}, "type": "issue", "id": 55, "repository": {"links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/ignitionrobotics/ign-cmake.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/ignitionrobotics/ign-cmake"}, "avatar": {"href": "data/bytebucket.org/ravatar/{3e77bcf7-f260-4cec-a1a0-116b8e298901}ts=default"}}, "type": "repository", "name": "ign-cmake", "full_name": "ignitionrobotics/ign-cmake", "uuid": "{3e77bcf7-f260-4cec-a1a0-116b8e298901}"}, "title": "Failing to build Target / does not exist"}, "content": {"raw": "Users should build their ROS workspaces using `catkin_make_isolated` or `catkin build`, not using `catkin_make`.", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>Users should build their ROS workspaces using <code>catkin_make_isolated</code> or <code>catkin build</code>, not using <code>catkin_make</code>.</p>", "type": "rendered"}, "created_on": "2019-03-29T04:10:39.911056+00:00", "user": {"display_name": "Michael Grey", "uuid": "{c1cdfe52-2887-474c-ae99-72fdc53a59c9}", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/%7Bc1cdfe52-2887-474c-ae99-72fdc53a59c9%7D"}, "html": {"href": "https://bitbucket.org/%7Bc1cdfe52-2887-474c-ae99-72fdc53a59c9%7D/"}, "avatar": {"href": "https://avatar-management--avatars.us-west-2.prod.public.atl-paas.net/557058:67759e29-d1df-465f-868d-047738e36fc9/d42d74cf-c1bd-4431-8288-07f543bbe325/128"}}, "nickname": "mxgrey", "type": "user", "account_id": "557058:67759e29-d1df-465f-868d-047738e36fc9"}, "updated_on": null, "type": "issue_comment", "id": 51388232}], "page": 1, "size": 15}
