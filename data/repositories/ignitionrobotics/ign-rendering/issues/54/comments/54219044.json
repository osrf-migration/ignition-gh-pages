I tried is as well with recent nvidia drivers and recent optics version and the result was quite similar as in the first comment. Based on your reply I tried it with downgraded drivers and optix 4 but the result was quite similar. Maybe a few more test passed, but not all. Do you have maybe a working image \\(e.g., docker\\) with your working code? With the help of that we might be able to tune a working environment.  \nWhat is your roadmap regarding the update of the code for recent optix versions?  \nThanks a lot!", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>Hi Ian,<br />\nI was so happy to see activity around this unique feature of ign-rendering.
