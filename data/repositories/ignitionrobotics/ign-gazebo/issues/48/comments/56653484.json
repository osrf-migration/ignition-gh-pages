I looked at your .sdf file to see if there were things that were not setup properly before delving into DART. I found that doing the following prevents the crash from happening:\n\n1. Remove the fixed joint between `world` and the `base_link` of the `conveyor` model\n1. Move `conveyor` vertically so that it's not in collision with the `ground_plane`\n1. Add correct `<inertial>` parameters to all of the links in the `conveyor` model\n\nHere is the new file: https://gist.github.com/azeey/cad3bb49f0e096f1e90b8f9adfd3ce4b\n\nAnd this is the result:\n\n![Peek 2020-03-24 22-35.gif](data/bitbucket.org/repo/8zodKzn/images/2568826325-Peek_2020-03-24_22-35.gif)\n\nThat being said, I don't think ign-gazebo should be crashing given the .sdf file you provided, so we'll keep this issue open and investigate the cause of the crash.", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>Thanks <span class=\"ap-mention\" data-atlassian-id=\"5e39fd3fe18f970e61a0a4cf\">@Jaldert Rombouts</span> for the reproducible example.
