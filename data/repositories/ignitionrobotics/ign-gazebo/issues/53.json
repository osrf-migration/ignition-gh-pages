For example, for a cartpole model, I need to routinely set the position/velocity of the cart and the angle/rate of the pole during the simulation is running. I looked at the functions provided by the ECM. I got to know how to obtain the states of a link by using the function `Component`. But I didn\u2019t see a function used to set the states of a link.\r\n\r\n\u200c\r\n\r\nCan anybody give me some instructions on this?
