They can overlap in their volumes as well as in the entities they contain (one entity can be in multiple levels). [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hemu6rlgzkQ) video covers levels pretty well.\nWe can have the concept of a default level that includes all entities not currently included in a level. This could include ground planes, global lights, heightmaps, etc. If a performer moves out of a level and is not in any other level, it would be considered to be in the default level.\n\nI am not sure we want to automatically define levels because they would be different depending on the application/environment. In a tunnel environment with a limited line of sight, a level can be a small volume. Whereas in an open environment, the level would have to be quite large.

I do take your point about it being error-prone, but providing good visualization and feedback to the user creating the levels might be easier than automatically creating levels.", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>I agree, levels can be flexible.
