I don't think it would be possible to move the system to another runner if that runner could be on another machine. \n\nThis might have already been mentioned by @carromj, but one possibility would be to have systems that are \"distributable\" and systems that are not (i.e, stay on the primary). Systems that are \"distributable\" would only use ign-transport to communicate with other systems. This is assuming ign-transport supports moving nodes as you mentioned earlier. When a distributable system needs to communicate outside ign-transport, the author of the system would need to write a non-distributable system to relay messages between ign-transport and the external communication scheme. \n\nAnother issue is how the internal state of a system is moved between runners. For example, a PID controller system would need to keep track of past errors. Options:\n  \n  * Require such systems to provide their own state serialization and passed the serialized state as the initial state when loading the system in the new runner.\n  * Require systems to store their state as components of an entity that represents the system and rely on component serialization.\n  * Provide a way (maybe using events) for a system being moved to send data to its destination and leave the details to the system author.", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>How do we handle systems that communicate with clients outside of ign-gazebo (e.g. ROS nodes)?
