But in both cases, there are other components which will need to be synced as well, but will be less common, such as mass changes for physics and material changes for rendering.\n\nAs for the effort, from what I've understood so far regarding ign-physics, this may be the big issue?

I don't think it would be possible to move the system to another runner if that runner could be on another machine. \n\nThis might have already been mentioned by @carromj, but one possibility would be to have systems that are \"distributable\" and systems that are not (i.e, stay on the primary). Systems that are \"distributable\" would only use ign-transport to communicate with other systems. This is assuming ign-transport supports moving nodes as you mentioned earlier. When a distributable system needs to communicate outside ign-transport, the author of the system would need to write a non-distributable system to relay messages between ign-transport and the external communication scheme. \n\nAnother issue is how the internal state of a system is moved between runners. For example, a PID controller system would need to keep track of past errors.
