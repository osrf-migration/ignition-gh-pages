I think the key here is that we shouldn't encourage joints to be controlled by setting velocity, which we all agree on. But I maintain that we shouldn't be setting the precedent of not exposing physics features because we think users may misuse them. Especially considering that the ROS interface will be done mainly through the transport bridge, and we want to expose as much functionality to ROS / Ignition transport users as possible. I can also see other legitimate use cases for `Joint::SetVelocity`, such as situations when you want to \"animate\" a joint. We just need to make sure everything is well documented and we're not putting bad examples out there - so we should plan to update the diff-drive plugin asap.\n\nThat said, I'm leaning towards renaming the current plugin to something like `JointSetVelocity` to make it clear that we're not encouraging that to be used as a controller.
