Previously, a fixed joint was created, but with the changes in [ign-physics PR #102](#!/ignitionrobotics/ign-physics/pull-requests/102/), an invalid entity is created because a Gearbox joint (at least, the way it's setup in the model) forms a kinematic loop. We have a few of options:\n\n* Comment out the gearbox joint in the test model. This would fix the test, but if anyone runs a world that contains a gearbox joint, it could crash ign-gazebo.\n* Check if a joint is valid in the physics system before adding it to the std::map that couples ign-gazebo joints with ign-physics joints. \n* Check if a joint type is supported in ign-gazebo before calling `ConstructJoint`.
