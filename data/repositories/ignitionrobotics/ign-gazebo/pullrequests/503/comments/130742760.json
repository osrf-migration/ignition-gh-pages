It is meant to say that even without a `--log-overwrite` flag or `SetLogRecordOverwrite()`, the default behavior of `LogRecord` plugin will still overwrite in any case.\n\nUpdate: I looked again. I see that with the removal of `LogRecordOverwrite()`, the second case also overwrites using this default behavior. It is still good to clarify that is the default behavior though, regardless of whether the path is set on SDF or by C\\+\\+ API. Where the path is set isn\u2019t what determines whether there is an overwrite; it\u2019s just default behavior. So as far as overwrite goes, I believe these tests are not testing different things. They are more testing functionality of the SDF and C\\+\\+ API themselves and should go into a test like LogAPI or something.", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>Hmm I think the original comment is more accurate and disambiguates this test from the two tests below.
