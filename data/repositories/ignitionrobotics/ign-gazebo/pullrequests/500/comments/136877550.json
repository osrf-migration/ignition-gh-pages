For example if `something` doesn\u2019t exist, but `something(1).zip` exists, then we want it to record to `something(2)` directory and write to `something(2).zip`. So it has to go back and rename the directory name too. It covers most cases.\n\nA case it does not cover is that it could rename the directory, then the zip, then the new named directory exists, and then it should really go back to rename the directory - it doesn\u2019t do that right now. I can think of a concrete example when I have a bit more time but I have seen it happen with the latest code. I thought it would be too ugly to go back and rename the directory and the zip a 3rd time.", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>Yeah, it\u2019s a bit tricky with some combination of existing files.
