A system that operates on camera images will need to wait at least one iteration for a new image to be generated. Maybe there are ways in which we can mitigate this.\n\nAnother thought that I had is the granularity of the decision to synchronize a component or not. The current proposal is going for a very granular approach where each entity keeps a different list of components to sync. I wonder if it may not make more sense to associate a component type itself with syncing, rather than on a per entity basis. So for example, all poses would be synced, and no images would be synced.
