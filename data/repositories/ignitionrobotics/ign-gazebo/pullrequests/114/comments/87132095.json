I think the major concerns have been captured. My statement \"Ign-sensors would become a repository of sensor models\", would be similar to distributing raw SDF description files but not the DOM/parser. Again taking camera as an example, a user of ign-sensor could instantiate a Camera and use it to generate images. All lifecycle management would be left up to the user.\n\nMoving management of sensors outside of ign-sensors could be beneficial also because:\n\n1. Instantiation of a sensor could require passing in a rendering engine or physics engine, or callbacks to get information fromm an engine.\n2. Logging data could be more efficient. Instead of relying on transport, we could directly access sensor data and dump it to a database along with other state information.\n3. Gazebo would have complete control over the sensor update cycle.\n\nI'll work on a design document for this, or update an existing document if one has already been started.", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>Thanks for the feedback.
