I like how casts are cached so that they don't hurt performance. I wanted to point out that it's not just the `MinimumFeatureList` that should not be modified. Even the `DetachableJointFeatureList` is now part of the ABI because adding a feature to it would break physics engine plugins that once worked. So if we really needed to add a feature to `DetachableJointFeatureList`, I guess we'll have to have another list, maybe `DetachableJointFeatureListWithNewFeature` and have some logic that tries to cast to `DetachableJointFeatureListWithNewFeature` first then fallback to `DetachableJointFeatureList`.
