Then ign-sensors could be a collection of systems.\n\nYes, systems are just plugins, so they can come from other libraries, but the library will need to depend on `ign-gazebo`. In the case of sensors, we would like `ign-gazebo` to ship with several default sensors by default, so we would need to find a way to ship those together.

We currently don't have a way to configure the update rate of each system though, so they're all running at the maximum rate.\n\n> We can then convert ign-sensors to a group of classes that are used in ign-gazebo\u2019s systems.\n\nYes, I think this could be a way to integrate it.
