After thinking about this for a bit, if we want SDF files to be portable across platforms, we need URIs to be consistent.

[Here](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/ie/2006/12/06/file-uris-in-windows/)'s a good resource.\n\nI propose we use proper URIs everywhere, and only on Windows, convert them to paths right before reading from and writing to disk. With that in mind, I also think we should rename the API from `FilePath` to `FileUri`.\n\nThis may cause breaking changes on Windows for users currently relying on absolute windows paths though. Let me see if I can support both windows paths and proper URIs side-by-side.\n", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>Sorry for the delay.
