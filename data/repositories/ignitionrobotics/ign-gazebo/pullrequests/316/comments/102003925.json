As soon as I release the mouse, the model's pose is sent to physics and the simulation continues from that pose, but what's shown on the scene doesn't reflect the new poses of the model. For example, if I translate a model vertically and release the mouse, the model starts falling in physics, but it remains at rest at in the scene at the translated position. When I finally select arrow mode the model's pose in the scene is instantaneously changed. I think we have two options here:\n\n* The new pose of the model is not sent to physics until we exit transform mode. Entering on a new transform mode, i.e, switching from translate to rotate, is not considered exiting transform mode. Clicking on a new object while still in transform mode is not considered exiting transform mode.\n* The new pose of the model is sent to physics as soon as the mouse is released. The pose of the \"active\" model and its gizmo should be updated with poses from physics. I believe this is the behavior of Gazebo classic.
