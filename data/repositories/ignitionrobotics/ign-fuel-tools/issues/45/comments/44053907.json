Assuming a server works with version 1, and eventually we release a version 2 API and the server adopts it. Should we store a different copy of the models downloaded using version 2? I see the version number as the language spoken between server and client but not affecting the models. What I believe it should change is the version number used in our configuration file. We should bump that version to `2.0`, and then, all requests (including `UniqueName()`) should use it. Maybe there are subtle details that we'll show up when implementing it but in theory I'd say that the version should be outside. In any case, I also don't have a strong opinion against it, if makes things easier.", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>Following up with the version number.
