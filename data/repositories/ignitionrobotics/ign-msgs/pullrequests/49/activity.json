vaguely recall during the early phase of the adoption of ign-cmake, I had accidentally moved the master header to be located in `ignition/project/project.hh` instead of `ignition/project.hh`. @caguero caught this and informed me about it, so I fixed the `install` command to install the master header back to `ignition/project.hh`.\r\n\r\nHowever, it seems that the file was still getting *configured* to `include/ignition/project/project.hh` even though it's been getting installed to the correct location. It seems that at some point, `ign-msgs` was changed to accommodate this, so `ign.cc` has been using `#include \"ignition/msgs/msgs.hh\"`.\r\n\r\nHere's where things get even funnier: The Components branch of `ign-cmake` was already fixed months ago to configure the master header to the correct location, even though the current `default` branch has been configuring to the wrong location. Because of this, `ign-msgs` fails to build against the Components branch of `ign-cmake`, since it can't find the file `ignition/msgs/msgs.hh` as it should actually be getting configured as `ignition/msgs.hh`.\r\n\r\nThis pull request sidesteps the issue entirely by just not using the master header.
